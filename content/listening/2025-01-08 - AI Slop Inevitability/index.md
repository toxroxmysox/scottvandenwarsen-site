This podcast from The Verge offered some commentary (starts at 1h 11m) on recent posts from Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri about [AI Images](https://www.theverge.com/news/852124/adam-mosseri-ai-images-video-instagram) and from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on [AI Slop](https://www.theverge.com/news/852630/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-scratchpad-blog-ai-slop-comments) and frustration that our current path of AI Instagram and Youtube creators and AI Image generators is already past the point where the tech leaders can make changes to course correct.

It's obvious to see the impacts of AI on the content we see, making it hard to trust if a picture or video is actually genuine or if it's something only created to get views or clicks or reactions to make a buck of advertisers. These platforms are actively choosing not to use their content moderation to deprioritize AI creations and aren't taking action to promote or tag genuine creators. If this continues, will we see only an endless cycle of AI generation feeding more AI summarization, or will genuine creators cut through the crowd?

I'm trying to be more intentional about what I read / see on the internet and prioritize my attention and dollars on genuine creators and artists instead of scrolling through a feed of who-knows-what designed to keep my attention for as long as possible. We'll see how long they last in the sea of AI ads and wasteful content.
